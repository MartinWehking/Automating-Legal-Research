# [Automating-Legal-Research](https://github.com/MartinWehking/Automating-Legal-Research)

With the "Automating legal research" project you can download build datasets from the translations of German legal texts found at [gesetze-im-internet.de](gesetze-im-internet.de). The datasets can be used to create TF-IDF and Doc2Vec vector spaces and perform clustering and clustering on it. Additionally you can use the vector spaces to search for documents similar to a given search term.

This project is the result of our work for the Text Mining Project at the University of Passau in the Wintersemester 17/18.
